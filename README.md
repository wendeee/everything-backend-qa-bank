# Everything Backend Engineering Core Concepts Q/A Bank

This is an open-source repository of questions and answers of core concepts in backend engineering, designed to help junior backend engineers gain clarity on core bacnkend concepts which comes in handy when preparing for technical interviews. This project covers essential backend concepts, programming language-specific questions, and practical examples to build confidence and knowledge.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository aims to:

- Provide a structured, high-quality resource for junior backend engineers to prepare for interviews.
- Cover core backend concepts like HTTP, databases, security, microservices, and cloud-native technologies.
- Include programming language-specific questions (Node.js, Python, Go, Java) with code samples.
- Foster a community-driven approach through open-source contributions.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Questions are organized by topic and include detailed answers, code samples, and follow-up questions. Current topics include:

- **Networking**: HTTP, RESTful APIs, WebSockets
- **Databases**: Relational vs Non-Relational, Indexing, Query Optimization
- **Security**: Authentication, Authorization, Secure Coding
- **Concurrency**: Event Loops, Processes vs Threads, Concurrency vs Parallelism
- **Microservices**: Design Patterns, Inter-Service Communication
- **Cloud-Native**: Containers (Docker, Kubernetes), Serverless Architectures
- **Language-Specific**:
  - Node.js
  - Python
  - Go
  - Java
